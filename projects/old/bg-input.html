    <h2>BGInput</h2>

    <p>In 2008, I wrote a Java app to record and graph my blood glucose against the effect of insulin and carbs:</p>

    <img src="bginput1.png">
    <ul>
      <li>The top graph includes <span style="color: blue;">BG</span>, <span style="color: red;">insulin</span> (including an idealized four-hour action curve with 90 minute peak), and <span style="color: green;">carbs</span>.
      <li>The hours 2:10-3:59 am are highlighted in dark grey on the graph because the user has highlighted those data rows in the table.
      <li>The hours 4:30-5:30 pm are highlighted in yellow on the graph because the "Comments" field includes an activity during that time span.
      <li>The record input field supports multiple input formats/shorthands to make data entry as fast as possible.
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>The Summary Graph shows two time periods (e.g. "have the last two weeks been better or worse than the last 60 days?"), with a color spectrum indicating the age of the line.
    </ul>
